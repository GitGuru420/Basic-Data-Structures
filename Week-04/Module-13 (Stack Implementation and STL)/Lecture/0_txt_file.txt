Q. What is Stack?
Ans. Stack is a Data Structure that follows LIFO(Last In First Out) techniques, 
which means data is inserted at the top and also removed from the top.

Stack
- Abstract Data Structure
- Higher Level Data Structure

# Array & Linked List are Lower Level Data Structure.

Complexity
- Delete at tail -> Singly Linked List: O(N)
- Delete at tail -> Array, Doubly: O(1)

Stack Operation
- push()
- pop()
- top()
- size()
- empty()
